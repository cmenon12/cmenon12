## Hi, I'm Christopher! ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m an aspiring second-year student at the University of Exeter studying joint Biology and Computer Science. I've been writing my own scripts in Python for a while now, and recently started writing my own Google Apps Scripts (in JavaScript) too. I always love being able to simplify tasks and solve my own real-life problems just by coding!
